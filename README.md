# Coding Practice

The "Rabbit Hole (Chapter 2)" question from Meta Careers:

It reminded me that there are some DFS based questions that are relatively tricky to code if you want to do them without using recursions.

* dfs.cpp: just depth-first search
* scc.cpp: compute strongly connected components using Kosaraju's algorithms (2 x dfs)
* rabit_hole.cpp: a solution of the Rabbit Hole question (SCC + critical-path using topological sorting of DAG).
